Arb - a C library for arbitrary-precision ball arithmetic
=============================================================

.. only:: latex

    Introduction
    ::::::::::::

    Welcome to Arb's documentation!
    Arb is a C library for rigorous real and complex arithmetic with arbitrary precision.
    Arb tracks numerical errors automatically using
    *ball arithmetic*, a form of interval arithmetic based on a midpoint-radius
    representation.
    On top of this, Arb provides a wide range of mathematical functionality, including polynomials,
    power series, matrices, integration, root-finding, and transcendental functions.
    Arb is designed with efficiency as a primary goal, and is usually competitive with or faster
    than other arbitrary-precision packages.
    The code is thread-safe, portable, and extensively tested.

    Arb is free software distributed under the
    GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1 or later
    (see :ref:`license`).

    The git repository is https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/

    Arb is developed by `Fredrik Johansson <http://fredrikj.net/>`_
    (fredrik.johansson@gmail.com), with help from many
    contributors (see :ref:`credits`).
    Questions and discussion about Arb are welcome on the
    `flint-devel <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/flint-devel>`_ mailing list.
    There is also an `issue tracker <https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/issues>`_
    for bug reports and feature requests.
    Development progress is sometimes covered on
    `Fredrik's blog <http://fredrikj.net/blog/>`_.

Floating-point numbers
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Arb uses two custom floating-point types in its implementation of ball
arithmetic. The radius of a ball is represented using the type *mag_t* which is
unsigned and has a fixed precision. The midpoint is represented using the
type *arf_t* which has arbitrary precision.

Real and complex numbers
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Real numbers (*arb_t*) are represented as midpoint-radius intervals,
also known as balls. Complex numbers (*acb_t*) are represented in rectangular
form, with *arb_t* balls for the real and imaginary parts.

Polynomials and power series
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

These modules implement dense univariate polynomials with real and complex
coefficients. Truncated power series are supported via methods acting
on polynomials, without introducing a separate power series type.

Matrices

These modules implement dense matrices with real and complex coefficients.
Rudimentary linear algebra is supported.

Special functions
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

These modules implement mathematical functions with complexity
that goes beyond the basics covered directly in the *arb* and *acb*
modules.

Calculus
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Using ball arithmetic, it is possible to do rigorous root-finding and
integration (among other operations)
with generic functions. This code should be considered experimental.
