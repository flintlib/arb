Arb - a C library for arbitrary-precision ball arithmetic
=============================================================

.. only:: latex

    Introduction
    ::::::::::::

    Welcome to Arb's documentation!
    Arb is a C library for rigorous real and complex arithmetic with arbitrary precision.
    Arb tracks numerical errors automatically using
    *ball arithmetic*, a form of interval arithmetic based on a midpoint-radius
    representation.
    On top of this, Arb provides a wide range of mathematical functionality, including polynomials,
    power series, matrices, integration, root-finding, and transcendental functions.
    Arb is designed with efficiency as a primary goal, and is usually competitive with or faster
    than other arbitrary-precision packages.
    The code is thread-safe, portable, and extensively tested.

    Arb is free software distributed under the
    GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1 or later
    (see :ref:`license`).

    The git repository is https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/

    Arb is developed by `Fredrik Johansson <http://fredrikj.net/>`_
    (fredrik.johansson@gmail.com), with help from many
    contributors (see :ref:`credits`).
    Questions and discussion about Arb are welcome on the
    `flint-devel <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/flint-devel>`_ mailing list.
    There is also an `issue tracker <https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/issues>`_
    for bug reports and feature requests.
    Development progress is sometimes covered on
    `Fredrik's blog <http://fredrikj.net/blog/>`_.

    This documentation is available in HTML format at http://arblib.org and in

    This edition of the documentation was updated
    |today| and describes Arb |version|.

Floating-point numbers
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Arb uses two custom floating-point types in its implementation of ball
arithmetic. The radius of a ball is represented using the type *mag_t* which is
unsigned and has a fixed precision. The midpoint is represented using the
type *arf_t* which has arbitrary precision.

Real and complex numbers
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Real numbers (*arb_t*) are represented as midpoint-radius intervals,
also known as balls. Complex numbers (*acb_t*) are represented in rectangular
form, with *arb_t* balls for the real and imaginary parts.

Polynomials and power series
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

These modules implement dense univariate polynomials with real and complex
coefficients. Truncated power series are supported via methods acting
on polynomials, without introducing a separate power series type.

Matrices

These modules implement dense matrices with real and complex coefficients.
Rudimentary linear algebra is supported.

Special functions
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

These modules implement mathematical functions with complexity
that goes beyond the basics covered directly in the *arb* and *acb*
modules.

Calculus
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Using ball arithmetic, it is possible to do rigorous root-finding and
integration (among other operations)
with generic functions. This code should be considered experimental.

Here, we give extra proofs, error bounds, and formulas that would be too
lengthy to reproduce in the documentation for each module.
